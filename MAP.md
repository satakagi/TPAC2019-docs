# Overview
I have been developing and standardizing SVG based web Mapping system for almost 20 years.
During this time, map services have evolved as silo-type by various IT vendors. Even a mapping framework that looks like an open source provided by a venture companies, the cloud-side services are silo.

Can we now see potential changes and signs of this situation?
