# Overview
I have been developing and standardizing SVG based web Mapping system for almost 20 years.
During this time, map services have evolved as silo-type by various IT vendors. Even mapping frameworks that looks like open source provided by venture companies, the cloud-side services remains silo.

Can we see any signs of a change to decentralized Web Mapping?

## Urgent demand
- Social infrastructure operator companies and local governments, such as mobile phone operators like us, widely use various other social infrastructure operational information and weather / geological information to deal with large-scale accidents and natural disasters. In view of the independence of each operator, this activity is preferably a decentralized system rather than relying on an aggregator.

## ISSUES

- Discontinuity between geo and web industry, geo engineers and web engineers, resulting in technology and spec mismatch
- Absence of business model in decentralized web mapping
