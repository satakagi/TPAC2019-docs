# Overview
I have been developing and standardizing SVG based web Mapping system for almost 20 years.
During this time, map services have evolved as silo-type by various IT vendors. Even mapping frameworks that looks like open source provided by venture companies, the cloud-side services remains silo.

From the very beginning, I have believed that the following decentralized type is "Web" Mapping.

Can we see any signs of a change to decentralized Web Mapping?


## Urgent demand
- Social infrastructure operator companies and local governments, such as mobile phone operators like us, widely use various other social infrastructure operational information and weather / geological information to deal with large-scale accidents and natural disasters. In view of the independence of business, this activity is preferably a decentralized system rather than relying on an aggregator company.
- According to [gartner's latest hype cycle for emerging technologies 2019](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trends-appear-on-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2019/), deentralized information technologies has been newly introduced, against the backdrop of various social situations.

## ISSUES

- Discontinuity between geo and web industry, geo engineers and web engineers, resulting in technology and spec mismatch
- Absence of business model in decentralized web mapping


## KDDI's submission and de-jure standardization regarding Web Mapping
- [Memmber submission](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/04/) on this 7th day of June, 2011
  - [Tiling and Layering Module for SVG 1.2 Tiny](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-SVGTL-20110607/)
- JIS (Japan's Industrial Standard)
  - X.7197 - Geographic Information -- Map representation and services based on SVG<br>
    It is equivalent specification to Tiling and Layering Module for SVG 1.2 Tiny. It also describes the correspondence between geospatial information definition in ISO TC211 and geographic data representation by SVG.

  - X.4197 - SVG Tiny 1.2<br>
    It is Japanese Translation of SVGT1.2) [Link1](https://webdesk.jsa.or.jp/books/W11M0090/index/?bunsyo_id=JIS%20X%204197:2012), [Link2](https://kikakurui.com/x4/X4197-2012-01.html)
